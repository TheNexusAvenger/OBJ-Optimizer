# OBJ-Optimizer
Optimizes the triangles in OBJ files. The intended workflow is for exporting OBJ files from Roblox made with the Solid Modeling engine, and re-importing them after running the optimizer. This was written in Java instead of Lua since it can directly interface with file systems, and works cross platform.
